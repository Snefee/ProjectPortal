# Project Portal
My attempt at recreating mechanics from the Portal game made by Valve Corporation in **Unreal Engine 5.5**.

# Implemented Mechanics

## Portals
Player can shoot two connected portals onto designated surfaces. The view through the portal is synchronized with the player's point of view.

## Physics-Based Object Interaction
Ability to grab, carry, and throw physics-enabled objects. These objects fully interact with the portals and other objects like pressure plates.
